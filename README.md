# Ahn 2011

This is a module to facilitate (my) understanding of Ahn *et. al.* [Flavor network and the principles of food pairing](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00196) Nature: SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 1 : 196 | DOI: 10.1038/srep00196 (2011), which is licensed as [CC-BY-NA-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/). This module includes some lightly edited, identically licensed versions of their supplementary data as well as similarly licensed data ([CC-BY-NA-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) from a later paper, Ahn *et. al.*[THE FLAVOR NETWORK](http://yongyeol.com/2013/05/17/paper-flavor-network.html) Leonardo, Volume 46, Issue 3, June 2013, p.272-273.

I was introduced to the general topic in a blog post, [Data Analysis in the Kitchen](https://blog.frontiersin.org/2017/07/20/frontiers-in-ict-data-analysis-in-the-kitchen/), by the open access scientific publisher [Frontiers](https://frontiersin.org). A perspective article explains the appeal:

> [T]he perception of food is an incredibly complex process involving the chemical properties of aroma compounds, the biochemistry of receptor proteins, the physiology of the mouth, nose, and other organs, the neuroscience of the olfactory bulb and brain, and the psychology of multi-sensory associations and memories. Similar to many other research disciplines, the highly interdisciplinary study of food perception, consumption, and culture is being transformed by the ubiquity of data sets—on flavor chemistry and biochemistry, but also on food consumption, eating habits, and culinary diversity—and new data analysis methods, including network analysis and machine learning.--Mouritsen, Edwards-Stuart, Ahn and Ahnert, [Food Perception, Preparation, Consumption, and Culture](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fict.2017.00015/full).
